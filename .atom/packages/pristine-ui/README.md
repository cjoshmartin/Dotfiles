### Install

Navigate to __Settings > Install__ , select __Themes__, and search for `pristine-ui`.

Once installed, this theme can be activated by going to the __Settings > Themes__ section and selecting "Pristine UI" from the __UI Themes__ drop-down menu.

### Settings

Since this theme is forked from One Dark UI, it brings along some nice additions of being able to tailor font sizes and layout modes.

In the theme settings you can change the __Font Size__ to scale the whole UI up or down.

Switch between 3 __Layout Modes__:

1. `Auto` (default) - In Auto mode, the UI and font size will automatically change based on the window size.
2. `Compact` - The UI stays compact, leaving more space for the editor.

3. `Spacious` - The UI is expanded, giving some breathing room.

And pick a __Tab Sizing__ mode:

1. `Auto` (default) - In Auto mode, the tabs switch based on the window size.
2. `Minimum` - In Minimum mode, the tabs will be as small as possible.
3. `Even` - In Even mode, all tabs will be the same size.

### Special Thanks
To the One Dark UI creators/contributors, without which this theme would not exist.
